# Python-Proficiency-for-Statistics
An assignment for DSC510 at GCU that emphasized development of elementary data loading, data cleaning, scientific computation and data analysis skills using Python, Pandas, and NumPy.

# Assignment Instructions
A researcher is conducting a study on the effects of different exercise regimens on blood pressure. The study involves 100 participants who are randomly assigned to one of three exercise groups: jogging, weightlifting, or yoga. Each participant's blood pressure is measured before and after the 6-week exercise program.

The researcher has collected the data and stored it in a CSV file. The file contains the following columns:

Participant ID (numeric)
Exercise group (text: "jogging," "weightlifting," or "yoga")
Pre-exercise systolic blood pressure (numeric)
Post-exercise systolic blood pressure (numeric)
The researcher wants to analyze the data using Python and NumPy. Complete the following tasks as part of the initial statistical analysis of the scenario above.

Tasks:

Generate Synthetic Dataset on Exercise and Blood Pressure

1.     Create a Python script that generates a synthetic dataset matching the description of your study. The dataset should be saved as a CSV file named "exercise_data.csv".

Highest Pre-Exercise Blood Pressure by Group

2.     Write a Python script to read the "exercise_data.csv" file and print the participant with the highest pre-exercise systolic blood pressure in each exercise group.

Extract the 5 Participants with Highest Blood Pressure

3.     Write a Python function that sorts the list based on blood pressure and displays the full record of the top 5.

Monthly Blood Pressure Changes

4.     Write a Python script that assumes that blood pressure measurements were taken monthly. Compute and print the average change in blood pressure for each exercise group. Note: This is hypothetical as the original study is for 6 weeks only.

Compare Pre- and Post-Exercise Blood Pressure

5.     Search for the 5 participants from the pre-exercise (Topic 4) and find their post-exercise blood pressure. Produce a table that compares their pre- and post-exercise pressure and displays the difference.

Total Blood Pressure Reduction for Each Exercise Group

6.     Write a Python script to read the "exercise_data.csv" file and compute the measures of central tendency for each exercise group: mean, mode, standard deviation.

Explain in detail the computational and statistical aspects of each task above. For example, the researcher may use NumPy to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the pre-exercise and post-exercise blood pressure measurements for each exercise group. The researcher may also use NumPy to calculate the difference between the pre- and post-exercise blood pressure measurements for each participant and to create a new array that contains only the differences. The researcher may use Python's control flow and logical operators to filter the data and select only the participants who had a decrease in blood pressure after the exercise program. The researcher may use NumPy to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the blood pressure differences for this subgroup and draw conclusions about the effectiveness of each exercise regimen in reducing blood pressure. Finally, a useful and informative task is completed.

Requirements:

All tasks must be completed using Python 3.x, or as specified by the instructor.
Use Jupyter notebooks to complete the tasks.
Use appropriate variable names and comments in the code.
Use NumPy for scientific computing tasks.
Include a markdown cell at the beginning of each task, explaining what the task is trying to accomplish and the mathematical explanation of the task.
Use the pandas library for reading and writing CSV files.
Use appropriate error handling in the code.
Submit the completed Jupyter notebook.
Grading will be based on correct implementation of the task, use of appropriate Python libraries, appropriate variable names and comments, appropriate error handling, and clarity of code.

Deliverables:

Submit a Jupyter notebook containing all Python code and written responses.
While APA style is not required for the body of this assignment, solid writing reflecting industry appropriate standardsâ€¯is expected. Remember to reference all datasets and resources according to APA formatting guidelines, which can be found in the APA Style Guide, located in the Student Success Center.
